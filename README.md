# APT-Attack-Simulation
This repository is a compilation of all  APT simulations that target many vital sectors,both private and governmental. The simulation includes written tools, C2 servers, backdoors, exploitation techniques, stagers, bootloaders, and many other tools that attackers might have used in actual attacks. These tools and TTPs  are simulated here.
